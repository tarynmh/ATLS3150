    <h1>Pokémon</h1>
    <p><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us" title="Pokémon homepage" target="_blank">Pokémon</a> is a franchise that I love! I've played many Pokémon games, and I even enjoy collecting plushies and figures of various Pokémon.</p>
    <p>I think everyone can find something to love about Pokémon, and everyone has a favorite Pokémon!</p>
